# Fibonacci Runtime Analyzer

## [Introduction]
	
Hello! This is my Fibonacci Runtime Analyzer that seeks to give 
a runtime comparison of an iterative and recursive approach to 
the fibonacci sequence. 
	
	
Upon starting, you may decide to either:
	
(1) Load a text file to read a batch of numbers
			or
(2) Quickly type a single input 


## [Technical Details]
	
This code is meant to save you the effort of counting every single
nanosecond by hand when usually calculating the fibonacci sequence.
It uses Double to store the value of numbers so it definately begins
to have computational errors after the input 35 or so.

Future improvements include:
#### Important
 -Implement a more stable structure than what Double can offer
 -Export results to a txt or Excel file
	
 #### Ideally would be nice:
 -Export charts of runtime data
 

The program is written in Java and uses all the standard Java libries.

## [Instructions]
	
In order to run this code you will need to import it into a Java IDE
(such as Eclipse) and run from the console.
